Code for 'Associating expression and genomic data using co-occurrence measures'

All important functions are located in OmicsData.py.
There are two important classes:
- ContinuousOmicsDataset: for qualitative data for continuous measurements such as expession
- DiscreteOmicsDataSet: for quantitative omics data such as presence of mutation/CN changes

Expression data can be made quantitive by applying a binning function on ContinuousOmicsDataset.


Other scripts are used for generating the results in the paper. 

A simple example will be added shortly.
